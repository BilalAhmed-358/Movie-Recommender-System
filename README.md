## Introduction

Recommendation systems are widely used in various applications to suggest items or content to users based on their preferences. This project demonstrates three popular recommendation algorithms: Naive Bayes, User-Based, and Content-Based. Each algorithm has its own approach to generating recommendations and can be applied to different types of data.

## Naive Bayes Recommendation Algorithm

The Naive Bayes recommendation algorithm is a probabilistic classifier that calculates the likelihood of an item being recommended based on its features and the preferences of users. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class, hence the "naive" assumption. This algorithm works well with categorical data and is often used for text classification.

## User-Based Recommendation Algorithm

The User-Based recommendation algorithm is a collaborative filtering technique that suggests items based on the similarity between users. It builds a user-item matrix and identifies similar users based on their item preferences. Recommendations are generated by finding items liked by similar users but not yet rated by the target user.

## Content-Based Recommendation Algorithm

The Content-Based recommendation algorithm suggests items to users based on the similarity between items themselves. It analyzes the features or content of the items and recommends similar items to those that a user has already liked or interacted with. This algorithm is useful when there is sufficient item metadata available.

## MovieLens Dataset

The MovieLens dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset for recommender systems. It contains movie ratings and information from the MovieLens website. The dataset includes user ratings, movie metadata, and movie-genome tags. The files required for this project are included in the `dataset/` directory.

- `ratings.csv`: Contains movie ratings provided by users.
- `movies.csv`: Contains movie metadata, including title and genres.
- `tags.csv`: Contains a set of tags describing the movie genome.

## Usage

To run this recommendation system project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
